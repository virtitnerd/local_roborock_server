# Installation

Start here for a first-time setup. The project supports two installation methods:

- Docker Compose on your own Linux host or VM
- the Home Assistant add-on from this repository

After the stack is running, continue with [Onboarding](onboarding.md) to pair a vacuum.

## Shared Requirements

- A domain name that you own
- A place to run the stack on your LAN
- A second machine for onboarding later. It needs Python 3.11+ and `uv` if you run the onboarding scripts there.
- A network that can host the stack's HTTPS and MQTT TLS ports internally. The defaults are `555` and `8881`.
- A Cloudflare API token with DNS edit access for the zone if you want Cloudflare DNS-01 auto-renew. See [Cloudflare setup](cloudflare_setup.md).
- Sufficient container resources: Allocate at least 1 CPU core and 1 GB of RAM. The server performs cryptographic operations during onboarding, and resource starvation can cause the handshake to silently stall or time out. You can reduce resources after you complete onboarding. If you do not allocate enough resources, just wait a little bit longer when it says "calculating public key".

## Credential Names

The setup uses three different credentials:

- The **admin password** signs in to the local server dashboard at `/admin`.
- The **protocol login email and PIN** are the local login that Home Assistant or the Roborock app use after you repoint them to this server.
- Your **Roborock cloud email and verification code** are used only by the admin dashboard's cloud import flow so the local server can fetch your current homes, rooms, routines, and known vacuums.

## Choose Your Certificate Path First

Before you run the setup wizard, check [Tested Vacuums](tested_vacuums.md).

Different vacuums trust different certificate chains. That determines whether you should:

- use `zerossl` with Cloudflare DNS-01 automation
- switch Cloudflare DNS-01 automation to `actalis`
- skip Cloudflare ACME and bring your own certificate files instead

For most users, prefer `zerossl`. Use `actalis` mainly for older vacuums or for models that already have tested-vacuum notes showing better compatibility with that chain.

If your model already has certificate notes on the tested-vacuums page, follow that guidance first. It is easier to choose the right certificate path up front than to reissue certs after onboarding starts.

## Network Setup

1. Pick a hostname for this application. It must be a subdomain of a domain you own, and it **must** start with `api-`.

   For example, if you own `example.com`, use `api-roborock.example.com`. Throughout the docs this is the **stack FQDN**.

   Onboarding also has a hard 32-character limit for the final `host[:port]/` value sent to the vacuum after the `api-` prefix is stripped. Short names are safer:

   - `api-rr.example.com` with the default port becomes `rr.example.com:555/` and fits.
   - `api-roborock-local-server.example.com` with the default port becomes `roborock-local-server.example.com:555/` and is too long.

2. Your network **must** handle its own DNS for the network the vacuum connects to. If the vacuum, phone, or onboarding machine uses an external DNS server like `8.8.8.8`, this will not work.

3. Create a local DNS record pointing your stack FQDN to the LAN IP of the machine running the stack.

   This should be split-horizon or local DNS through your router, Pi-hole, AdGuard Home, Unbound, or similar. Cloudflare DNS-01 certificate issuance does not require public inbound access, public port forwarding, or Cloudflare proxying.

   If you want the stack to work away from your home network, the server does handle auth and lets you disable new devices from connecting. That still makes this a publicly accessible self-hosted service, so only do it if you know what you are doing. Local-only access is always the better option when it fits your workflow.

4. From a client on the same network the vacuum will use, verify the name resolves to the server's LAN IP:

   ```bash
   nslookup api-roborock.example.com
   ```

   For the first setup and onboarding flow, your home network clients should resolve this name to the server's LAN IP. If they resolve to a public IP, make sure your router and firewall setup intentionally support that path before continuing.

   With the current server behavior, the same hostname is advertised for both HTTPS and MQTT/TLS, so you do not need a separate `mqtt-...` hostname unless you have built your own custom client routing around one.

   If a reverse proxy maps public ports to different backend listener ports, see [Reverse Proxy](reverse_proxy.md) before starting the stack.

## Method 1: Docker Compose

### Additional Requirements

- Docker with `docker compose`
- Python
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

### Steps

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Python-roborock/local_roborock_server
   cd local_roborock_server
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. Run the setup wizard.

   You have two options here, and they write the same `config.toml`:

   - **In your browser (no `uv`/Python needed on the host):** skip straight to step 6 and start the container
     with no `config.toml` present. It boots into a setup wizard, served in plain HTTP at `/admin` on your
     configured HTTPS port (`http://<this host>:555/admin` by default), that asks for the same fields as the
     CLI wizard below. Submitting it writes `config.toml`, and the container restarts itself into the full
     HTTPS/MQTT stack - reload the page after a few seconds and you're at the real (now HTTPS) admin login.
   - **On the command line:**

     ```bash
     uv run roborock-local-server configure
     ```

   You can also combine the two: if `ROBOROCK_SERVER_*` env vars generate `config.toml`'s network/broker/TLS
   settings but the admin ones (`ROBOROCK_SERVER_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `ROBOROCK_SERVER_PROTOCOL_LOGIN_EMAIL`,
   `ROBOROCK_SERVER_PROTOCOL_LOGIN_PIN`) are left unset, the container still boots into `/admin`, but the
   wizard notices the rest is already configured and only asks for admin credentials. Useful for a
   reverse-proxy or ACME setup you'd rather express as env vars/IaC, while still picking the admin password
   in a browser instead of a compose file.

   The wizard asks for:

   - `stack_fqdn` (must start with `api-`)
   - HTTPS and MQTT TLS ports if you do not want the defaults `555` and `8881`
   - embedded MQTT or your own broker
   - whether to use Cloudflare DNS-01 auto-renew
   - if you chose Cloudflare, the ACME account email and which CA to use: ZeroSSL, Actalis, Let's Encrypt, or SSL.com. In most cases, choose ZeroSSL unless you are targeting an older vacuum or a specific model's compatibility report points elsewhere.
   - if you chose Actalis or SSL.com, that CA's EAB KID and EAB HMAC key (both require External Account Binding; ZeroSSL and Let's Encrypt do not)
   - your admin password
   - your Home Assistant/app login email and 6-digit PIN

   It then writes `config.toml`, generates `admin.password_hash` and `admin.session_secret`, and if you chose Cloudflare it also writes `secrets/cloudflare_token`. If you also chose `acme_server = actalis`, it writes `secrets/acme_eab_kid` and `secrets/acme_eab_hmac_key`.

4. If you chose external MQTT with the CLI wizard, fill in `broker.host` in `config.toml` before starting the stack (the browser wizard asks for the broker host directly, so this step doesn't apply there). See [Custom MQTT](custom_mqtt.md).

5. If you skipped Cloudflare, put your certificate files in `data/certs/fullchain.pem` and `data/certs/privkey.pem` (relative to the repository root on the host, which maps to `/data/certs/` inside the container). This is the path to use when your vacuum works better with a certificate chain you manage yourself. See [Custom certificate management](custom_cert_management.md).

6. Start the container:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

   If you changed `network.https_port` or `network.mqtt_tls_port` in `config.toml`, set matching Docker Compose variables before you start the stack so the published ports stay aligned. For example:

   ```bash
   ROBOROCK_SERVER_HTTPS_PORT=8443
   ROBOROCK_SERVER_MQTT_TLS_PORT=9443
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

   In PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   $env:ROBOROCK_SERVER_HTTPS_PORT = "8443"
   $env:ROBOROCK_SERVER_MQTT_TLS_PORT = "9443"
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

   For reverse proxy setups, keep `network.https_port` and `network.mqtt_tls_port` set to the backend listener ports and use `network.advertised_https_port` / `network.advertised_mqtt_tls_port` for the public ports.

### Alternative: Environment Variables Only (No `uv` Toolchain)

If you don't want to install `uv`/Python on the host just to run `configure`, you can set `ROBOROCK_SERVER_*` environment variables instead. On first boot, if `/data/config.toml` doesn't already exist, the container generates one from these variables and starts normally. If `config.toml` already exists (mounted or previously generated), it always wins and the env vars are ignored — this never overwrites a config you've already set up.

Required variables:

- `ROBOROCK_SERVER_STACK_FQDN`
- Either `ROBOROCK_SERVER_CERT_FILE` + `ROBOROCK_SERVER_KEY_FILE` (bring your own certificate), or `ROBOROCK_SERVER_TLS_MODE=cloudflare_acme` + `ROBOROCK_SERVER_TLS_BASE_DOMAIN` + `ROBOROCK_SERVER_TLS_EMAIL` + `ROBOROCK_SERVER_CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN` (or `_CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN_FILE` for a Docker secret)

The admin credentials are optional as a group:

- Set all three of `ROBOROCK_SERVER_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `ROBOROCK_SERVER_PROTOCOL_LOGIN_EMAIL`, and
  `ROBOROCK_SERVER_PROTOCOL_LOGIN_PIN` (6 digits) for a fully headless boot straight into the running stack.
- Leave all three unset, and the container still generates `config.toml`'s network/broker/TLS settings from
  the env vars above, then boots into the setup wizard at `/admin` - which notices the rest is already
  configured and asks only for admin credentials. Handy if you're driving the network/TLS/reverse-proxy side
  from env vars or IaC, but would still rather pick the admin password in a browser.
- Setting some but not all three is rejected with a clear error, to avoid a half-set credential.

Commonly-set optional variables: `ROBOROCK_SERVER_HTTPS_PORT`, `ROBOROCK_SERVER_MQTT_TLS_PORT`, `ROBOROCK_SERVER_ADVERTISED_HTTPS_PORT`, `ROBOROCK_SERVER_ADVERTISED_MQTT_TLS_PORT`, `ROBOROCK_SERVER_LISTENER_MODE`, `ROBOROCK_SERVER_BROKER_MODE` + `ROBOROCK_SERVER_BROKER_HOST`. See `env_config.py` for the full list.

**Important:** if you go this route, remove (or comment out) both the `./config.toml:/app/config.toml:ro` and `./secrets:/run/secrets:ro` lines from `compose.yaml`. Docker will otherwise bind-mount a nonexistent host path as an empty file, which the container treats as an existing (but invalid) config and never falls through to the env vars. Keep the `./data:/data` mount - a plaintext `ROBOROCK_SERVER_CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN` (or EAB credential) is written to `/data/secrets/` at boot, no separate secrets mount needed. Use `ROBOROCK_SERVER_CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN_FILE` instead if you'd rather point at a secret file you manage yourself.

Fully headless (no browser step at all):

```bash
export ROBOROCK_SERVER_STACK_FQDN=api-roborock.example.com
export ROBOROCK_SERVER_ADMIN_PASSWORD=super-secret-password
export ROBOROCK_SERVER_PROTOCOL_LOGIN_EMAIL=user@example.com
export ROBOROCK_SERVER_PROTOCOL_LOGIN_PIN=123456
export ROBOROCK_SERVER_TLS_MODE=cloudflare_acme
export ROBOROCK_SERVER_TLS_BASE_DOMAIN=example.com
export ROBOROCK_SERVER_TLS_EMAIL=acme@example.com
export ROBOROCK_SERVER_CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN=your-cloudflare-api-token
docker compose up -d --build
```

Hybrid (network/TLS from env vars, admin credentials in the browser wizard at `/admin`):

```bash
export ROBOROCK_SERVER_STACK_FQDN=api-roborock.example.com
export ROBOROCK_SERVER_TLS_MODE=cloudflare_acme
export ROBOROCK_SERVER_TLS_BASE_DOMAIN=example.com
export ROBOROCK_SERVER_TLS_EMAIL=acme@example.com
export ROBOROCK_SERVER_CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN=your-cloudflare-api-token
docker compose up -d --build
```

## Method 2: Home Assistant Add-on

Use [Home Assistant](home_assistant.md) as the installation guide if you want to run the stack as a Home Assistant add-on instead of Docker Compose.

## After The Stack Starts

1. Open the admin dashboard at `https://api-roborock.example.com:555/admin` by default, or `https://api-roborock.example.com:YOUR_HTTPS_PORT/admin` if you chose a custom HTTPS port.

2. If the page does not load, check the container and DNS before onboarding:

   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   docker compose logs -f roborock-local-server
   nslookup api-roborock.example.com
   ```

3. Import your data from the cloud so things like routines and rooms will work. Enter your Roborock cloud email under cloud import, select **Send code**, then enter the returned code and select **Fetch data**.

4. For any routines that use zones, re-save them so the server stores the zone data correctly. In the Roborock app, open each routine that has zones, open the zone, tap **Edit**, open any **Zone Cleaning** entry, then tap **Save**. Repeat for each zone in the routine.

5. The dashboard's **Activity** panel shows recent HTTP/MQTT traffic between your vacuum(s)/app/Home Assistant and this server - useful for confirming a device is actually talking to the local stack. It only shows redacted metadata (method/path/topic/RPC method name, sizes, timestamps) by default, since the underlying logs can contain device keys and decrypted command payloads. Set `ROBOROCK_SERVER_ACTIVITY_RAW=1` if you need full unredacted entries for debugging.
