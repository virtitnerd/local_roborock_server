# Installation

Start here for a first-time setup. The project supports two installation methods:

- Docker Compose on your own Linux host or VM
- the Home Assistant add-on from this repository

After the stack is running, continue with [Onboarding](onboarding.md) to pair a vacuum.

## Shared Requirements

- A domain name that you own
- A place to run the stack on your LAN
- A second machine for onboarding later. It needs Python 3.11+ and `uv` if you run the onboarding scripts there.
- A network that can host the stack's HTTPS and MQTT TLS ports internally. The defaults are `555` and `8881`.
- A Cloudflare API token with DNS edit access for the zone if you want Cloudflare DNS-01 auto-renew. See [Cloudflare setup](cloudflare_setup.md).

## Credential Names

The setup uses three different credentials:

- The **admin password** signs in to the local server dashboard at `/admin`.
- The **protocol login email and PIN** are the local login that Home Assistant or the Roborock app use after you repoint them to this server.
- Your **Roborock cloud email and verification code** are used only by the admin dashboard's cloud import flow so the local server can fetch your current homes, rooms, routines, and known vacuums.

## Choose Your Certificate Path First

Before you run the setup wizard, check [Tested Vacuums](tested_vacuums.md).

Different vacuums trust different certificate chains. That determines whether you should:

- use `zerossl` with Cloudflare DNS-01 automation
- switch Cloudflare DNS-01 automation to `actalis`
- skip Cloudflare ACME and bring your own certificate files instead

For most users, prefer `zerossl`. Use `actalis` mainly for older vacuums or for models that already have tested-vacuum notes showing better compatibility with that chain.

If your model already has certificate notes on the tested-vacuums page, follow that guidance first. It is easier to choose the right certificate path up front than to reissue certs after onboarding starts.

## Network Setup

1. Pick a hostname for this application. It must be a subdomain of a domain you own, and it **must** start with `api-`.

   For example, if you own `example.com`, use `api-roborock.example.com`. Throughout the docs this is the **stack FQDN**.

   Onboarding also has a hard 32-character limit for the final `host[:port]/` value sent to the vacuum after the `api-` prefix is stripped. Short names are safer:

   - `api-rr.example.com` with the default port becomes `rr.example.com:555/` and fits.
   - `api-roborock-local-server.example.com` with the default port becomes `roborock-local-server.example.com:555/` and is too long.

2. Your network **must** handle its own DNS for the network the vacuum connects to. If the vacuum, phone, or onboarding machine uses an external DNS server like `8.8.8.8`, this will not work.

3. Create a local DNS record pointing your stack FQDN to the LAN IP of the machine running the stack.

   This should be split-horizon or local DNS through your router, Pi-hole, AdGuard Home, Unbound, or similar. Cloudflare DNS-01 certificate issuance does not require public inbound access, public port forwarding, or Cloudflare proxying.

   If you want the stack to work away from your home network, the server does handle auth and lets you disable new devices from connecting. That still makes this a publicly accessible self-hosted service, so only do it if you know what you are doing. Local-only access is always the better option when it fits your workflow.

4. From a client on the same network the vacuum will use, verify the name resolves to the server's LAN IP:

   ```bash
   nslookup api-roborock.example.com
   ```

   For the first setup and onboarding flow, your home network clients should resolve this name to the server's LAN IP. If they resolve to a public IP, make sure your router and firewall setup intentionally support that path before continuing.

   With the current server behavior, the same hostname is advertised for both HTTPS and MQTT/TLS, so you do not need a separate `mqtt-...` hostname unless you have built your own custom client routing around one.

   If a reverse proxy maps public ports to different backend listener ports, see [Reverse Proxy](reverse_proxy.md) before starting the stack.

## Method 1: Docker Compose

### Additional Requirements

- Docker with `docker compose`
- Python
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

### Steps

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Python-roborock/local_roborock_server
   cd local_roborock_server
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. Run the setup wizard:

   ```bash
   uv run roborock-local-server configure
   ```

   The wizard asks for:

   - `stack_fqdn` (must start with `api-`)
   - HTTPS and MQTT TLS ports if you do not want the defaults `555` and `8881`
   - embedded MQTT or your own broker
   - whether to use Cloudflare DNS-01 auto-renew
   - if you chose Cloudflare, the ACME account email and whether to use ZeroSSL or Actalis. In most cases, choose ZeroSSL unless you are targeting an older vacuum.
   - if you chose Actalis, the Actalis EAB KID and EAB HMAC key
   - your admin password
   - your Home Assistant/app login email and 6-digit PIN

   It then writes `config.toml`, generates `admin.password_hash` and `admin.session_secret`, and if you chose Cloudflare it also writes `secrets/cloudflare_token`. If you also chose `acme_server = actalis`, it writes `secrets/acme_eab_kid` and `secrets/acme_eab_hmac_key`.

4. If you chose external MQTT, fill in `broker.host` in `config.toml` before starting the stack. See [Custom MQTT](custom_mqtt.md).

5. If you skipped Cloudflare, put your certificate files in `data/certs/fullchain.pem` and `data/certs/privkey.pem` (relative to the repository root on the host, which maps to `/data/certs/` inside the container). This is the path to use when your vacuum works better with a certificate chain you manage yourself. See [Custom certificate management](custom_cert_management.md).

6. Start the container:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

   If you changed `network.https_port` or `network.mqtt_tls_port` in `config.toml`, set matching Docker Compose variables before you start the stack so the published ports stay aligned. For example:

   ```bash
   ROBOROCK_SERVER_HTTPS_PORT=8443
   ROBOROCK_SERVER_MQTT_TLS_PORT=9443
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

   In PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   $env:ROBOROCK_SERVER_HTTPS_PORT = "8443"
   $env:ROBOROCK_SERVER_MQTT_TLS_PORT = "9443"
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

   For reverse proxy setups, keep `network.https_port` and `network.mqtt_tls_port` set to the backend listener ports and use `network.advertised_https_port` / `network.advertised_mqtt_tls_port` for the public ports.

## Method 2: Home Assistant Add-on

Use [Home Assistant](home_assistant.md) as the installation guide if you want to run the stack as a Home Assistant add-on instead of Docker Compose.

## After The Stack Starts

1. Open the admin dashboard at `https://api-roborock.example.com:555/admin` by default, or `https://api-roborock.example.com:YOUR_HTTPS_PORT/admin` if you chose a custom HTTPS port.

2. If the page does not load, check the container and DNS before onboarding:

   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   docker compose logs -f roborock-local-server
   nslookup api-roborock.example.com
   ```

3. Import your data from the cloud so things like routines and rooms will work. Enter your Roborock cloud email under cloud import, select **Send code**, then enter the returned code and select **Fetch data**.

4. For any routines that use zones, re-save them so the server stores the zone data correctly. In the Roborock app, open each routine that has zones, open the zone, tap **Edit**, open any **Zone Cleaning** entry, then tap **Save**. Repeat for each zone in the routine.

5. The dashboard's **Activity** panel shows recent HTTP/MQTT traffic between your vacuum(s)/app/Home Assistant and this server - useful for confirming a device is actually talking to the local stack. It only shows redacted metadata (method/path/topic/RPC method name, sizes, timestamps) by default, since the underlying logs can contain device keys and decrypted command payloads. Set `ROBOROCK_SERVER_ACTIVITY_RAW=1` if you need full unredacted entries for debugging.
