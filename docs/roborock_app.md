# Mobile App Options

After [Installation](installation.md) and [Onboarding](onboarding.md), you have options for controlling your vacuum from a mobile device:

1. **[Official Roborock App](#official-roborock-app)** — The official Roborock app redirected to talk to your local stack via MITM interception and (on Android) a patched APK.
2. **[LocalRock (Third-Party App)](#localrock-third-party-app)** — An open-source app created by Sidon that connects directly to this server.

## Official Roborock App

Use this after [Installation](installation.md) and [Onboarding](onboarding.md) if you want the official Roborock app to talk to your local stack.

During the MITM login step, the script now needs to sync the captured protocol-auth session back to your server. Pass `admin.session_secret` from the active server config as `--sync-secret`. That sync callback always uses the `--local-api` host and port.

The launcher can auto-load a sync secret from `config.toml` beside `mitm_redirect.py`, but that is only correct when that file matches the config used by the running server. If you run the MITM step from a second machine, or your server is using a generated Home Assistant config or another config file, pass `--sync-secret` explicitly.

The launcher now preflights that callback before starting `mitmweb`. If the `--local-api` host cannot be reached, if the TLS certificate does not validate for that host, or if the sync secret is rejected, the script exits immediately instead of letting you proceed into a broken login flow.

### Watching App Traffic In The Dashboard

Add `--activity-sync` (off by default) to also send a copy of each redirected request/response to your server's admin dashboard, so you can watch what the official app is doing from the **Activity** panel without leaving the browser:

```bash
uv run mitm_redirect.py --local-api api-roborock.example.com --sync-secret YOUR_ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET --activity-sync
```

This uses the same `--sync-secret` as the login sync above - no separate secret to manage. The Activity panel redacts these entries (method/host/path/status only) by default, since this traffic includes real Roborock account tokens; set `ROBOROCK_SERVER_ACTIVITY_RAW=1` on the server if you need full headers/bodies for debugging. Because each captured request blocks briefly on a network call to your server, leave this off for normal daily use and only turn it on for an active debugging session.

### iPhone

1. Log out of the app on your phone.

2. On a machine that is not running the server, run the MITM script:

   ```bash
   uv run mitm_redirect.py --local-api api-roborock.example.com --sync-secret YOUR_ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET
   ```

   Use the `admin.session_secret` value from the config file your running server actually uses for `YOUR_ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET`.

   If startup fails with `invalid_sync_secret`, the launcher either auto-loaded the wrong local `config.toml` or you copied a stale secret. Re-read `admin.session_secret` from the active server config and pass it explicitly with `--sync-secret`.

   If you use the default local stack ports, host-only values are fine here: the script assumes HTTPS `:555` and MQTT TLS `:8881`.

   If your stack uses custom ports, include them directly. For example:

   ```bash
   uv run mitm_redirect.py --local-api api-roborock.example.com:8443 --local-mqtt api-roborock.example.com:9443 --sync-secret YOUR_ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET
   ```

   The `--local-api` hostname must resolve from the MITM machine and match the HTTPS certificate served by your local stack. A raw IP such as `127.0.0.1` will fail unless your certificate is valid for that IP.

3. Install the WireGuard app on your phone. Then tap the plus button in WireGuard, choose to add from QR code, and scan the code at `http://127.0.0.1:8081/#/capture`.

4. Open `mitm.it` in your web browser (iPhone). Follow the instructions there for your device. In Safari, complete all device-specific steps, including installing and trusting the certificate.

5. Once the MITM setup is working, open the Roborock app, log back in, enter your verification code, and the server should automatically show the vacuums already known to your local stack. Turn off WireGuard, disable the MITM certificate, and then open one of your devices to confirm the map loads.

### Android

> **Note:** It is recommended to disable auto update in the Roborock App.

> **Note:** This workaround has only been tested and confirmed working on Roborock app version **4.60.06**. Newer versions may ship a different `librrcodec.so` with different offsets, in which case the patch script will need to be updated.

Android 7+ (API level 24+) only trusts system certificates, so the app will reject the MITM certificate by default. On top of that, the Roborock app includes a native library (`librrcodec.so`) that checks the APK's signing certificate on startup and kills the process if it doesn't match, meaning a simple `apk-mitm` patch isn't enough.

To work around both issues, you need to patch `librrcodec.so` to remove the integrity check, then repackage the APK.

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [apk-mitm](https://github.com/nicbarker/apk-mitm) (`npm install -g apk-mitm`)
- [apktool](https://apktool.org/)
- [zipalign](https://developer.android.com/tools/zipalign) and [apksigner](https://developer.android.com/tools/apksigner) (part of Android SDK build-tools)
- [keytool](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/specs/man/keytool.html) (part of JDK)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

#### Patching the APK

1. Download the Roborock APK (e.g. from [APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/roborock/roborock/)) and place it in your working directory.

2. Run `apk-mitm` to patch the APK for certificate trust:

   ```bash
      apk-mitm roborock.apk
   ```

3. Decompile the patched APK:

   ```bash
      apktool d roborock-patched.apk -o roborock_work
   ```

4. Patch `librrcodec.so` to remove the signature integrity check.

   First, save a copy of the original `librrcodec.so` as `librrcodec.so.bak`.

   ```bash
      cp roborock_work/lib/arm64-v8a/librrcodec.so roborock_work/lib/arm64-v8a/librrcodec.so.bak
   ```

   Now run the patcher from the repository root using the script in `patcher/`. You can pass the path to `librrcodec.so` explicitly (as shown below), or run it with no arguments from inside the unpacked APK and it will find the file itself.

   > Use `python` or `python3` depending on your system (Python 3.8+ is required).

      ```bash
         python patcher/patch_librrcodec.py roborock_work/lib/arm64-v8a/librrcodec.so
      ```

5. Rebuild the APK:

   ```bash
      apktool b roborock_work -o roborock_unaligned.apk
   ```

6. Align the APK using `zipalign`:

   Android 11+ (API level 30+) requires uncompressed native libraries (`.so` files) to be 4-byte page-aligned inside the APK. Running `zipalign` must be done **before** signing with `apksigner`. Skipping this step will cause installation to fail with an uncompressed/alignment error (`INSTALL_FAILED_INVALID_APK: Failed to extract native libraries, res=-124` / `Failed parse`).

   ```bash
      zipalign -p -f 4 roborock_unaligned.apk roborock_final.apk
   ```

7. Sign the APK. You have two options:

   **Option A** — Create a new signing key and sign:

   ```bash
      keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-key.keystore -alias mykey -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
      apksigner sign --ks my-key.keystore roborock_final.apk
   ```

   **Option B** — Use an existing JKS keystore:

   ```bash
      apksigner sign --ks my-key.jks --v1-signing-enabled true --v2-signing-enabled true roborock_final.apk
   ```

8. Uninstall the original Roborock app from your phone (required because the signing key is different), then install the patched APK:

   ```bash
      adb uninstall com.roborock.smart
      adb install roborock_final.apk
   ```

9. On a machine that is not running the server, run the MITM script:

   ```bash
      uv run mitm_redirect.py --local-api api-roborock.example.com --sync-secret YOUR_ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET
   ```

   Use the `admin.session_secret` value from the config file your running server actually uses for `YOUR_ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET`.

   If startup fails with `invalid_sync_secret`, the launcher either auto-loaded the wrong local `config.toml` or you copied a stale secret. Re-read `admin.session_secret` from the active server config and pass it explicitly with `--sync-secret`.

   If you use the default local stack ports, host-only values are fine here: the script assumes HTTPS `:555` and MQTT TLS `:8881`.

   If your stack uses custom ports, include them directly. For example:

   ```bash
      uv run mitm_redirect.py --local-api api-roborock.example.com:8443 --local-mqtt api-roborock.example.com:9443 --sync-secret YOUR_ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET
   ```

   The `--local-api` hostname must resolve from the MITM machine and match the HTTPS certificate served by your local stack. A raw IP such as `127.0.0.1` will fail unless your certificate is valid for that IP.

10. Install the WireGuard app on your phone. Then tap the plus button in WireGuard, choose to add from QR code, and scan the code at `http://127.0.0.1:8081/#/capture`.

11. Open `mitm.it` in your web browser (Android). Follow the instructions there for your device. In Chrome, complete all device-specific steps, including installing and trusting the certificate.

12. Once the MITM setup is working, open the Roborock app, log back in, enter your verification code, and the server should automatically show the vacuums already known to your local stack. Then close the Roborock app, turn off WireGuard, disable or delete the MITM certificate, reopen the Roborock app, and select your device or devices to confirm the map loads.


#### What the patch does

During `JNI_OnLoad`, `librrcodec.so` calls a verification function that retrieves the APK's signing certificate via `PackageManager.getPackageInfo()`, hashes it with `MessageDigest`, and compares it against a hardcoded value. If the hash doesn't match, it calls `Process.killProcess()`. The patch replaces the two `BL` (branch-link) instructions that call this function with `NOP`, so the check never runs. In the disassembly, these call sites are at VA `0x4bdcc` and `0x4c428`; in `patcher/patch_librrcodec.py`, the corresponding file offsets are `0x4adcc` and `0x4b428`. The crypto functions the app actually needs are unaffected.

> **Note:** This patch has only been tested and confirmed working on Roborock app version **4.60.06**, against the `librrcodec.so` with build ID `becc35bc1a75903df1eae3f90b380ca5403d06cb`. If Roborock releases a new app version, the virtual addresses and file offsets may change and the patch script will need to be updated.

## LocalRock (Third-Party App)

[LocalRock](https://github.com/DonSidro/LocalRock) is an open-source app created by **Sidon Kodraliu** ([@DonSidro](https://github.com/DonSidro)) that connects directly to the local Roborock server.

- **Google Play:** [LocalRock on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kodraliu.localrock&hl=en_US&pli=1)
- **App Store:** [LocalRock on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/dk/app/localrock/id6788538720)
- **Source Code:** [DonSidro/LocalRock on GitHub](https://github.com/DonSidro/LocalRock)

> **Notice:** I did not make this app, nor do I maintain it.

### Why use LocalRock?
- **Less likely to break:** Unlike the official Roborock app, LocalRock talks natively to the local server over HTTPS and MQTT. It does not require running a MITM proxy, installing custom root certificates, WireGuard redirection, or patching and re-signing native APK libraries (`librrcodec.so`). App updates will not break your setup.
- **Alternative onboarding technique:** LocalRock includes an "Add vacuum" flow that provisions new vacuums over Wi-Fi directly from your phone. This serves as a convenient alternative to running the onboarding scripts (`start_onboarding.py` / `start_onboarding_gui.py`) from a second computer (see [Onboarding](onboarding.md#alternative-onboarding-via-localrock)).

### Trade-offs
- **You may lose features:** Because LocalRock is an independent client reverse-engineered from the protocol, you may lose some advanced or proprietary features found in the official Roborock app (e.g. customized multi-floor/3D maps, complex routines, and camera live streaming is experimental/untested).
