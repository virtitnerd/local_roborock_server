# Onboarding

Before you start, finish [Installation](installation.md) and make sure the server is reachable on your `api-...` hostname. If you want a compatibility snapshot, also check [Tested vacuums](tested_vacuums.md).

Make sure you have already completed the cloud import/fetch-data step from Installation before starting onboarding. If you skip that step, the onboarding tools will not know which vacuum to target and you can end up with `No known vacuums are available for onboarding.`

If this is a brand new vacuum, it is still a good idea to set it up once in the official Roborock app first so the app can fetch the vacuum's current metadata. I would skip doing any firmware updates unless you know the latest firmware version is supported.

## Onboarding Methods

You can onboard your vacuum using either of the following approaches:

1. **[Via Computer (CLI or Web UI)](#guided-flow-cli)** — Run the guided onboarding script (`start_onboarding.py` or `start_onboarding_gui.py`) from a second machine on your network.
2. **[Via Mobile App (LocalRock)](#alternative-onboarding-via-localrock)** — Provision directly from your phone over Wi-Fi using the third-party LocalRock app.

---

## Guided Flow (CLI)

Run onboarding from a second machine, not from the machine hosting the local server:

- It needs Python 3.11+ and `uv`.
- It must be able to switch from your normal Wi-Fi to the vacuum's temporary Wi-Fi hotspot and back.
- It must resolve your `api-...` stack hostname to the server's LAN IP when it is back on your normal Wi-Fi.

```bash
uv run start_onboarding.py --server api-roborock.example.com
```

If you omit the port, the CLI assumes the default local stack HTTPS port `555`. If your stack uses a custom HTTPS port, include it in `--server`, for example `api-roborock.example.com:8443`.

This can be run from a checkout of this repository. If you copy the CLI to another machine instead, keep `start_onboarding.py` and `onboarding_shared.py` together in the same directory and run it with `uv`.

Onboarding has a hard `token.r` limit of 32 characters after normalization to the final `host[:port]/` value sent to the vacuum. 

The guided CLI will:

1. Log into the main server with your admin password.
2. Show the known vacuums that can be onboarded, with status lines such as `Qrevo MaxV [Public Key Determined] [Disconnected]`.
3. Prompt for any missing local Wi-Fi details on the second machine.
4. Ask you to reset the vacuum Wi-Fi, join the vacuum's Wi-Fi network, and press Enter when ready.
5. Send the cfgwifi onboarding packet.
6. Ask you to reconnect the second machine to your normal Wi-Fi.
7. Wait for the main server to become reachable again, then poll it every 5 seconds for up to 5 minutes to see whether query samples increased, the public key was recovered, or the vacuum connected.
8. Tell you whether to retry, wait, choose a different vacuum, or finish.

You do not need to watch the admin dashboard manually during the loop anymore.

## Onboarding A Vacuum That Was Never On The Cloud

Normally you finish the cloud import/fetch-data step first so the server knows which vacuum to target. A brand new vacuum that has **never** been added to the Roborock cloud has no inventory entry, so it will not appear in the known-vacuum list.

For that case, both the CLI and the GUI offer a **New vacuum** option in the vacuum-selection step:

- In the CLI it is listed one past the known vacuums (or type `new`).
- In the GUI it is a **New vacuum** button shown below any imported devices.

Selecting it starts a "blind" onboarding session: instead of targeting a known device, the server adopts whatever vacuum identity (`did`) shows up in the onboarding traffic. The vacuum presents its own `did`; the server mints the `localKey`. Once the vacuum reaches NC Prepare and registers, the server **auto-adds it to the inventory**, so it then shows up like any other device and Home Assistant's device list can see it.

Everything else in the flow is identical: you still reset the vacuum Wi-Fi, send the onboarding packet, and reconnect. Both V1 and V2 vacuums are supported.

## Prompts And Defaults

The only required CLI flag is `--server`. The script will prompt for anything missing:

- `admin password`: Your local server admin password (to authenticate with the onboarding API).
- `ssid`: Your 2.4 GHz home Wi-Fi network name.
- `password`: Your home Wi-Fi password.
- `timezone`: An IANA timezone string (default: `America/New_York`).
- `cst`: POSIX timezone string used by the vacuum firmware for local scheduling and clock synchronization (e.g. `EST5EDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0` or `CET-1CEST,M3.5.0,M10.5.0/3`).
- `country-domain`: The country or region code sent to the vacuum firmware in the local Wi-Fi configuration payload (e.g. `us`, `eu`, `de`, `at`, `gb`).

You can still pass them explicitly if you prefer:

```bash
uv run start_onboarding.py --server api-roborock.example.com --ssid "My Wifi" --password "Password123" --timezone "America/New_York" --cst EST5EDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0 --country-domain us
```

`server` should be your real stack hostname, usually the same `api-...` hostname you use for `/admin`. If you omit the port, the CLI assumes `:555`. Explicit ports are supported, so if your admin page is at `https://api-roborock.example.com:8443/admin`, use `--server api-roborock.example.com:8443`.

## Country Domain (`--country-domain`)

The `country-domain` parameter sets the regional/country domain code inside the Roborock Wi-Fi pairing payload (`"country_domain": ...`).

- **Auto-detection**: If your IANA timezone is in the script's built-in table (such as US timezones, London, Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam, Vienna, Rome, Madrid, Warsaw, Stockholm, Zurich, Brussels, Moscow, Tokyo, Sydney), both `cst` and `country-domain` are auto-detected (mapping European timezones to `eu` and Russian timezones to `ru`).
- **Unlisted timezones**: If you enter an unlisted European timezone (e.g. `Europe/Dublin`), the script defaults the country domain to `eu` and prompts for the POSIX `cst` string. If the timezone is completely unmapped, it prompts for both:
  ```text
  Country domain (could not auto-detect from timezone) [us]:
  ```
- **What to enter**: Roborock's cloud regional domains are `eu`, `us`, `cn`, and `ru`. For European users, use `eu`.

## CST Examples

Eastern Time (US): `EST5EDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0`

Central Time (US): `CST6CDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0`

Mountain Time (US - with DST): `MST7MDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0`

Mountain Time (Arizona - no DST): `MST7`

Pacific Time (US): `PST8PDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0`

London (UK): `GMT0BST,M3.5.0,M10.5.0`

Central Europe (Paris/Berlin/Vienna/Rome/Zurich): `CET-1CEST,M3.5.0,M10.5.0/3`

India (No DST): `IST-5:30`

Japan (No DST): `JST-9`

## What To Expect

- The first successful attempt usually increases the query sample count.
- If the sample count increases but the public key is still missing, run another cycle.
- Public-key recovery can take several minutes. On some newer models, the query sample count stays at zero during recovery; watch for **Public Key determined** instead.
- Once the public key is ready, the script will tell you to do one final pairing cycle so the vacuum connects fully.
- Some vacuums are slow on that final cycle and may take a few minutes before they say Wi-Fi connected or show up as connected in the server.
- Some vacuums need 2-4 cycles total.
- If something goes wrong, the CLI lets you `retry`, `refresh`, `reselect`, or `quit`.

You still need to reset the vacuum's Wi-Fi manually. On many Roborock models that means holding the two buttons on the dock or the left and right buttons on the vacuum for 3-5 seconds until you hear the Wi-Fi reset prompt. Do a Wi-Fi reset, not a full factory reset. If you are unsure, search for your exact model's Wi-Fi reset steps.

Congrats! Once the script reports that the vacuum is connected to the local server, the onboarding flow is complete.

## Web UI (start_onboarding_gui.py)

If you would rather not use the terminal, there is a web UI version of the same flow. It runs a small local server on your machine and opens your browser automatically:

```bash
uv run start_onboarding_gui.py
```

No CLI flags. All configuration happens in the browser form on first load.

Enter the same server host you use for `/admin`. If your stack runs on a custom HTTPS port, include it in the form, for example `api-roborock.example.com:8443`.

The same onboarding `token.r` limit applies in the GUI: the final `host[:port]/` value must be 32 characters or less.

The main reason to use the GUI version is that this flow makes you switch your machine between your normal Wi-Fi and the vacuum's Wi-Fi hotspot several times. A browser talking to `127.0.0.1` keeps working through those switches. The CLI version can get into a bad state if a blocking network call hits while you are still on the vacuum hotspot.

### What it does on startup

1. Picks a random free port on `127.0.0.1`.
2. Generates a random per-run access token.
3. Starts a local server bound to localhost only.
4. Opens your default browser to `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/?token=<token>`.

The server is not reachable from your LAN. The token is included in the launch URL and is required for the protected UI/API requests, so other processes or browser tabs on the same machine cannot drive the onboarding flow unless they have that URL. If the browser does not open on its own, copy the URL printed in the terminal (including the `?token=...` part) and open it manually.

### The five phases

The UI shows a stepper across the top and walks you through five phases:

1. **Configure.** Fill in the server host, admin password, your home Wi-Fi SSID and password, timezone, and country domain. The POSIX TZ string and country domain are auto-derived from the timezone if you leave them blank. Same fields as the CLI, just in a form.
2. **Select vacuum.** The script logs into the main server and lists the known vacuums with pills showing whether each has a public key, is connected, and how many query samples it has. Click one to start a session.
3. **Send onboarding.** Reset the vacuum's Wi-Fi, join its hotspot on this machine, then click "Send onboarding packet". The script sends the cfgwifi packet to `192.168.8.1` over the hotspot.
4. **Reconnect and poll.** Switch back to your normal Wi-Fi. The UI waits for the main server to become reachable again (up to two minutes), then polls every few seconds for up to five minutes. That five-minute window is for the vacuum to make progress, not a deadline for you to reconnect instantly. If you know you are already back online, click "I'm back online, skip the wait".
5. **Done.** The UI tells you whether to run another cycle, pick a different vacuum, or finish.

A live log pane below the stepper shows every packet, status check, and state transition. This is the same information the CLI prints to the terminal.

Your inputs live only in memory for the duration of the run and are discarded when you click Quit or shut down the server.

Unlike `start_onboarding.py`, the GUI flow also serves the local HTML file. If you copy it to another machine, keep `start_onboarding_gui.py`, `ui.html`, and `onboarding_shared.py` together in the same directory.

### Same caveats as the CLI

Everything in "What To Expect" above still applies. Some vacuums need 2-4 cycles, the Wi-Fi reset on the vacuum is still manual, and the POSIX TZ examples are the same. Only the interface changed, the underlying packet flow is identical.

### Troubleshooting

- **The browser didn't open.** Copy the URL printed in the terminal (including the `?token=...` query string) and open it manually.
- **"Onboarding send failed" right after clicking send.** You are probably not joined to the vacuum's hotspot yet, or the vacuum is not in pairing mode. Reset its Wi-Fi and try again.
- **"No known vacuums are available for onboarding."** Go back and finish the cloud import/fetch-data step first so the server has the vacuum inventory.
- **"Could not reach the server after leaving the vacuum hotspot."** Your machine did not rejoin your normal Wi-Fi within two minutes. Check your network and click Retry.
- **The UI is stuck on "Polling...".** Give it the full five-minute timeout. Some vacuums are especially slow on the final cycle after the public key is already ready. If nothing changes, check the log pane for errors, then click Retry or Pick another vacuum.
- **Server stalls or hangs during key recovery without errors.** Check your container host's resource usage. If running with tight CPU/memory limits, cryptographic recovery can max out resources and hang. Ensure the container has at least 1 CPU core and 1 GB RAM allocated. On lower resource machines, be prepared to wait longer for the public key to be determined.

## Alternative: Onboarding Via LocalRock

> **Notice:** I did not make this app, nor do I maintain it. LocalRock was created by Sidon ([@DonSidro](https://github.com/DonSidro)).

If you have a smartphone, you can use [LocalRock](roborock_app.md#localrock-third-party-app) (available for Android and iOS) to onboard your vacuum directly from your phone without needing a second computer:
 
1. Connect LocalRock to your local server by providing your server URL and login credentials.
2. Select the **Add vacuum** option in the app.
3. Reset your vacuum's Wi-Fi (press and hold the two dock buttons or the left/right buttons on the vacuum for 3–5 seconds until you hear the Wi-Fi reset alert).
4. Follow the in-app prompts to connect your phone to the vacuum's temporary Wi-Fi hotspot and send your home Wi-Fi credentials.
5. The app will complete the handshake, recover the key, and verify that the vacuum connects to your local server.
